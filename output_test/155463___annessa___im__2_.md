The Company benefits from high volumes of repeat business from 98% of customers, with some relationships spanning over 12 years. 114. Sales are primarily generated via an in-house mobile application that was developed to streamline the ordering process for customers whilst creating cost savings across the sales department.

As such, there is considerable scope for expansion. 116. Annessa Imports is currently focused on increasing wine sales, which our Clients believe to have significant potential for growth. The recent recruitment of a wine specialist to the sales team is expected to drive activity in this area. 117.

The Directors are looking to expand Annessa Imports' customer base, with scope to achieve nationwide coverage by establishing a second depot in the north of the UK. The Company is also in the process of approaching supermarkets as part of a joint venture with one of its suppliers, which could see it supplying a range of pasta products on their shelves. 119. The Company could benefit from increased sales and marketing activity, including investment in an e-commerce website, which would allow it to sell directly to smaller businesses or the general public. MANAGEMENT AND STAFF 1.20. Annessa Imports is managed primarily by the four Directors, Domenico Annessa, Gaetano Alfano, Gianni Enrico Annessa and Maria Giovanna Annessa. They are supported by an experienced team comprising 51 employees. 1.21.

Utilised as warehouse and office space, the 21,000 sq ft premises are owned by the Shareholders and leased to the Company for £372k per annum on an annual rolling lease. 1.25.

  "text": "GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES\n\nOVERVIEW\n\n4.1. Our Clients have advised that there is considerable scope for Annessa Imports to achieve future growth, with the Company’s existing product range, customer base and supplier network presenting opportunities for future expansion.\n\nTHE MARKET\n\n4.2. Annessa Imports operates in the food and drink import market, which our Clients estimate has a value of circa £70m. The Company is believed to have an 18% share of this market, with its customers primarily operating within the food service industry.\n\n4.3. There are approximately 43,700 full-service restaurants in the UK, over 88% of which are independent businesses or part of small chains. The largest proportion of these restaurants are located in London and South East England, many of which cater to tourists or residents with high disposable income.³\n\n4.4. The restaurant industry is currently valued at £23.3bn, approximately 90% of which is attributed to sales of food and alcoholic beverages. While the Covid-19 pandemic and ongoing cost of living crisis have caused a decline in recent years, industry revenue is expected to grow at a compound annual rate of 5.6% to reach £30.6bn by 2028.\n\n4.5. Our Clients have advised that its primary customer base comprises mid-tier restaurants, which are typically less sensitive to changes in economic circumstances. As such, Annessa Imports is expected to generate a steady stream of revenue from its existing relationships for the foreseeable future.\n\n4.6. The popularity of Italian products in the UK has remained consistently strong over the last few years, with the overall share of the UK food and drink market taken by Italian products increasing from 5.6% to 6.3% in 2023, placing Italy as the seventh largest food and drink supplier to the UK.²\n\n4.7. Demand for European cured meat is expected to remain strong, with a 2022 report by Assica, the association of Italian meat and charcuterie industries, highlighting a 16% increase in the volume of cured meats exported to the UK.³\n\n4.8. Similarly, Italy was one of the top two countries of origin for wine imported into the United Kingdom in 2022. The import value from the top five countries of origin came to approximately £2.48bn in 2022, of which £767m came from Italy alone.⁴",
